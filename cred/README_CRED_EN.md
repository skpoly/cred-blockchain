# CRED Standard

**A decentralized, fair and transparent monetary infrastructure. Built to last.**

## ⚙️ What is CRED?

CRED Standard is a new blockchain protocol inspired by the original vision of Bitcoin:  
a censorship-resistant, decentralized and trustless system — but redesigned for the real world of today.

CRED is not a speculative asset. It is not a product. It is a **public infrastructure**, designed to:

- Be mined by anyone using standard CPUs and GPUs (anti-ASIC PoW)
- Run light nodes on smartphones to maximize global participation
- Enable **free transactions** via a dynamic reward mechanism
- Guarantee **programmable scarcity** with no pre-mines, ICOs, or privileged allocations
- Maintain **no central governance**, ever — just open source code and voluntary consensus
- Offer **modular privacy**, transparency and simplicity by design

## 📜 Vision

> "When currencies devalue, we build value. CRED."

CRED Standard is not just a blockchain — it's a movement.

A movement to reclaim monetary sovereignty, to empower individuals, to rebuild trust.

CRED is built for resilience, transparency, and inclusion. It proposes a dual structure:  
- **CRED** as a store of value  
- **Credix** (future) as a spendable currency for everyday use

This ecosystem aims to be **decentralized, sustainable and accessible**.
